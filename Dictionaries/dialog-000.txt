Our support team in Berlin doesn't communicate with us anymore, we must expect the worst, they are probably dead because of the nuclear bomb.
However their last report about this planet said it was filled with plenty of resources and it is one of the few adapted to human life conditions.
There is only one minor issue, the satelite camera took a picture of a terrible creature, big, scary and mercyless, that lived here. Further research has identified him as Kazarum Kizariam.
Your first task should be to erradicate him and all his minions from this planet, in order to do so I will provide you with our last military supplies, a sword and a gun choose wisely when you face the monsters.
