Hey, traveller what are you doing in Icarus, my name is Harold I am one of the survivors of the X-Bomb. I worked here alongside several other engineers providing Germany with satellite support during the WW3.
Wow you know commander Adolf, what an honour. This satellite has been broken since the explosion, it is impossible that he have been providing intel to you, maybe someone has lied.
Do you want the hexacrom? Such a heat resistent material was used in order to build Icarus and also the X-bomb... However if you want to get it you will need to talk to the scientist who developed it.
He was a nice dude... but now he is crazy, he locked himself in the control room after the explosion with all the Hexacrom reserves. Now I hear him shouting loud at night, he calls himself The Algebrist.
Good luck talking to him.
