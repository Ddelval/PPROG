Oh my goodness, thank you for saving me from those monsters. My name is Ciri, I am the only person left in Roseland, sometime ago those creepy creatures started to show up in these lands
I have been hiding from them since that moment. Have you come to get some titaniun?
I have lied to you sir, I am not the only inhabitant in Roseland, The Watcher lives here too and he is likely to be angry at you, he uses titaniun to build his telescope.
If you are not afraid of facing him, you should know that he has been milleniums observing everything and has developed the ability of prediction, he will likely dogde our strikes, unless he cant, of course.
