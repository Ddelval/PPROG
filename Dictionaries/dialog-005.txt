Oh my goodness, thank you for saving me from those monsters. My name is Ciri, I am the only person left in Roseland, sometime ago those creepy creatures started to show up in these lands
I have been hiding from them ever since. Have you come to get some titaniun?
I must reveal to you that there is a dangerous Watcher who inhabits this planet. He will be angry at you, since he uses titaniun to build his telescope.
If you are not afraid of facing him, you should know that he has been alive for milleniums observing everything and has developed the ability of prediction, he will likely dogde your strikes, unless he cant, of course.
