Hello Gerald, our first priority right now is to get some basic resources so that we can repair the tools that were damaged by the rough landing.
To begin with, I need you to bring us some wood and stone. Your equipement will enable you to gather them by just selecting collect in the menu.
Good luck. I will be expecting the resources as soon as possible

With these resources we will now be able to start fixing our tools.
However, while you were collecting them, we were able to get our furnaces working so now you will be able to get iron from iron ore and coal.
If you also get some wood, you will be able to craft a basic weapon that should be enough for you next mission.
Get the iron ore and craft a basic Iron sword.
Getting armed
As Adolf told you, you have to get the iron ore, turn it into iron and use it to craft the sword

Hi Gerald. I see that you already got you first weapon. I know that it is not much but it is all we have until we can get the tools in the spacecraft ready.
Now we need you to go explore a few caves that our intel team found before we got here. There are three of them in the north of this region.
Our scanners confirmed that in one of them you will find a creature called Kazarum Kizarim.
Beating it will not be easy but we cannot stablish a colony here with such creatures wandering around.
Also, we just found some blueprints in the storage module that will allow us to build a city hall. Hopefully, you can get the materials there. 
I will need you to bring 3 sacks of cement.
Cave exploration
To fulfill this quest you will need to explore the three caves and get the cement that you can find in them
