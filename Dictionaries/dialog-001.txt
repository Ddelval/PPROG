Hello Gerald, our first priority right now is to get some basic resources so that we can repair the tools that were damaged by the rough landing.
To begin with, I need you to bring us some wood and stone. Your equipement will enable you to gather them by just selecting collect in the menu.
Good luck. I will be expecting the resources as soon as possible

With these resources we will now be able to start fixing our tools.
However, while you were collecting them, we were able to get our furnaces working so now you will be able to get iron from iron ore and coal.
If you also get some wood, you will be able to craft a basic weapon that should be enough for you next mission.
Get the iron ore and craft a basic Iron sword.
Getting armed
As Adolf told you, you have to get the iron ore, turn it into iron and use it to craft the sword
