Hello Gerald, our first priority right now is to get some basic resources so that we can repair the tools that were damaged by the rough landing.
To begin, I need you to bring us some wood and stone. Your equipement will enable you to gather them by selecting collect in the menu.
Good luck. I will be expecting the resources as soon as possible

With these resources we will now be able to start fixing our tools.
However, while you were collecting them, we were able to get our furnaces working so now you will be able to create iron from iron ore and coal.
In addition to some wood, you will be able to craft a basic weapon that should be enough for you next mission.
Get the iron ore and craft a basic Iron sword.
Getting armed
As Adolf told you, you have to get the iron ore, turn it into iron and use it to craft the sword

I see that you already got your first weapon. I know that it is not much but it is all we have until we can get the tools in the spacecraft ready.
Now we need you to go explore a few caves that our intel team found before we got here. There are three of them in the north, and north east of this region.
Our scanners confirmed that in one of them you will find a creature called Kazarum Kizarim.
Beating it will not be easy but we cannot establish an existence here with such creatures wandering around.
Also, we just found some blueprints in the storage module that will allow us to build a city hall. Hopefully, you can get the materials there. 
I will need you to bring 3 sacks of cement.

To fulfill this quest you will need to explore the three caves and get the cement that you can find in them

Great job Gerald. We can see that all the enemies have been defeated and you have been able to collect the resources that we needed for the city hall.
You can now clear a small area of the map and place it using the crafting menu.

Well, this is starting to take some shape, now that I have seen your skills, I feel confident enough to send you into another planet, but be ready, widely challenging adventures await you there.
Your task is to obtain some crafty materials that cannot be found naturally in this place in order to construct some new structures.
Roseland
This weird planet is the place where you will find Titanium, go there and bring the materials here, safely.

Gerald I am so glad to see you again and with Titanium, well now you should be able to build some more buildings.
In order to accomodate all the people that will come in the rocket from Earth, we will need you to build some houses.

Great. We only need one more building to be able to accomodate to our comrades needs. A power station.
However, in order to build one, we will need Uranium and Hexacrom.
The only planet that would contain both of those is Icarus. You shall explore the planet and find Uranium and Hexacrom. 
Exploring Icarus
Icarus is a small planet rich in resources but you are not the only one that craves them.

I have seen the new power plants Gerald. With those, we should be able to provide electricity to all our new inhabitants
The rocket from Earth will be here any minute, and we have everything ready.
You can just sit down and relax.
